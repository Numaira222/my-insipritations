            I love bycicling because it's fun! It helps you exercise and it's a really good way to be fit. I love it when I go through bumps; I have to be determined. I also love steep places, but not too steep! Then you don't have to keep paddling and the breeze flows beside you; it's a wonderful feeling! Then a while ago my sister learned how to bicycle with two wheels and I still remember the joy I felt. Even though she is not faster than me, I like to bycicle beside her and chat about random things. Bycicling is my favourite sport. Not only is it very enjoyable, it also helps you be relaxed. :)
